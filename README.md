# HPC-LEAP PPI (protein-protein interactions analyses), and OBP (olfactory networks project)

# HPC-LEAP PPI (protein-protein interactions analyses)
./scripts/string: 	ppi analyses
./data/string_ppis: 	ppi analyses, input/output data, mainly STRING DB integrations

## OLD: HPC-LEAP PPI-NinjaViewer (NinjaViewer-curated PPIs involved, postentially, in explaining refractoriness of some Anopheline species to Pf)
./scripts/ppi-ninja: 	@TODO
./data/ppi-ninja: 	@TODO

# HPC-LEAP OBP (odorant binding proteins, as part of the early-stage olfactory networks project
./scripts/obp: olfactory networks project
./data/obp_input: olfactory networks project, input/output data mainly Qiao et al. (experimental) vs. mOBP (computational): OBP vs. Ligand binding assay screens. Qiao vouch for "cooperative binding" of OBP molecules, whereas mOBP screened ligand using only homodimers of OBP molecules. The two studies disagreed, so can we incorporate dimerisation in mOBP pipeline to reconcile differences? Inc. ladderplots, multiple sequence alignments, etc.
./data/obp_output: ^^
